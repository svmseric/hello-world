hello-world
===========

My first repo on this interesting site called github. I have no idea what to place here at this time, but thought i'd at least put what I am using github for.

I've decided to starting learning about openstack, i'm going to be using github quite often to grab code from other members of the openstack community. If I keep at it, maybe I can one day contribute myself.
